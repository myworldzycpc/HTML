Cold December wind passed right through my worn coat. I had wished to be at home, but those days it wasn't much warmer there than standing at the bus stop. Mama had written a letter to the electric company explaining that we were late in paying our bill because my sister was ill and Daddy had been laid off, but the power was cut off anyway. That's why we were on our way into town to pay the bill in person.

I sat close to Buddy Earl for warmth on the bus when it finally showed up. The walk to the electric company office from the bus stop was only a couple of blocks, but it was a relief to get inside.

After setting the bill Mama brought us to Rich's department store. There was Santa in a big wooden chair. "you to go and talk to him," he said. "Just don't expect to get all you ask for." Buddy Earl and I joined the line of children waiting, and Mama sat on a bench nearby.

Then Santa started talking with us and asked us what we wanted. Santa reached in his pocket, pulled out a notepad and scribbled something with a pencil. "Is your mother with you two?" he asked. I pointed to the bench. "That's our mama over there. She's waiting for us to finish." Santa lifted Buddy Earl off his knee. "Could you ask her to come and talk to me?" he said.

Later, Mama and Stana talked for a few minutes. Santa took a couple more notes. Then Mama brought us home. We didn't dare ask about their private conversation. Christmas morning Mama and Daddy gathered us around out tree to give thanks for all we had. There were no toys from Santa under the tree. No presents at all, really. But that was okay, especially since we had electricity again. I felt pretty good as I took my seat at the kitchen table.

Mama and Daddy looked at each other, and she unpacked the food from the box. "I'm sorry, children," she said. "We don't have much to eat today, but we'll make it through." She put a plate of food in front of each of us. 

We ate the food, and I felt a little better. Then Daddy said, "I'm sorry, children. I know you're hungry, but we don't have much money. I'm going to have to go out and look for work again." He got up and left the room.

We aren't sad or angry. We're just hungry. I don't know how long we'll have to wait for Daddy to come home. I don't know how long we'll have to wait for Christmas. But I know we'll make it through. We always do.

The gift is already reached. the electricity is the biggest gift. I think.

Everything in our lives is a gift. We just have to be thankful for it. Everything is enjoyable, even the bad things.
