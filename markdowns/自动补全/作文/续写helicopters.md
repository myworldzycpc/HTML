But no more helicopters came and it was dark. She was very tired and she went to sleep. She was woken up by a loud noise. She looked up and saw a helicopter. It was flying very low. It was flying over the sky. 

It was daybreak when Jane woke up. She seemed to see the hope. She took off her yellow blouse, and she run to a open area. She flagged the yellow blouse. Soon, a helicopter came. It was flying very low. It was flying over the sky. A few minutes later, the helicopters landed. The people on the helicopters come down from them. 

Jane ran to them, they go on to the helicopters and flied away.

Every quarrel can be solved. Just like Jane and her husband. They quarrelled, but they solved it. They are happy now. They are a happy family.
