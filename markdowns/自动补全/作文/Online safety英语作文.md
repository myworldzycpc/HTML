# Online Safety

Hello everyone!

I'm Li Hua. I'm a student from China. Last Friday, our school hold a English speech competition and I won the first prize. I'm very happy. I want to share my speech with you. It's about online safety.

When we are online, we should be careful. We should not give our personal information to others. We should not tell others our passwords. We should not tell others our address. We should not tell others our phone number. 

After this competition, we all realised that online safety is very important.
